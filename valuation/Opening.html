    Thank you for taking the time to be part of this Behavioral Study of University Students’ Economic Decision for research purposes. The purpose of this research is to study university students’ economic decisions under risk and ambiguity.  We expect to include 50 participants in this study.  The survey and experiment will take about 40 minutes of your time. Your participation in this study is voluntary and your decision will have no impact on your relationship with Ye Jin and Hao Shen (the investigators) or with NYU Shanghai.
    <br /> <br />
    The survey includes some questions that may be sensitive or personal. You are free to skip any question for any reason.  There is minimal risk in participating in this survey but there is always the risk of privacy leaking.
    <br /> <br />
    In this study, you will be asked to complete an experiment and a survey. We will record the following information about you: your economic decision under ambiguity and risk, your basic information, your household investing habit, and your financial literacy, and we will protect the confidentiality of your research information by storing all data on personal computers offline and confidentially. Only the main investigators have the opportunity to reach the data. 
    <br /> <br />
    You may not benefit from this study except for the stipend of completing the study but the information gathered from this survey and experiment may help with studying behavioral factors on economic decisions. As the survey will ask you to play with lottery tickets, your stipend amount will be the money amount of the lottery realization. The expected amount of the stipend is 40 RMB per person.
    <br /> <br />
    By agreeing to continue with this survey, you are consenting to participate in this research study with the understanding that you are free to withdraw at any time.  If at any time you wish to discontinue your participation, you may exit the survey, and it will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. If you withdraw from the study, the data collected will be removed from the study. If you are an NYU Shanghai student, participation or refusal will not affect your grades or academic standing.
    <br /> <br />
    If you have any questions about this study or have a complication or injury that you believe may be related to this study, please contact Ye Jin at yj392@nyu.edu.
